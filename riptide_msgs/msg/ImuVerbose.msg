# Note on status flags:
# Status flags are implemented as bit-fields.
#  0 = invalid
#  1 = valid
#  2 = valid and referenced to magnetic north
#
# Note that covariance on orientation becomes invalid as pitch angle exceeds 70 # degrees. This will be indicated by the status flag.

#NOTE: any data field with the prefix "raw_" means it is direct output from the Estimation Kalman Filter

#NOTE: All angles are in [deg], all distances are in [m]
